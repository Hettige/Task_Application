# Task_Application
This is a web based application. This Task Application created by Laravel PHP framework and MySQL as the database.
To use this application in localhost you must have install the laravel framework in your PC. 
Also you must have installed XAMPP, Visual Studio Code and composer to make other operations successful. 
Download this ZIP file and extract it to your PC at any location. Then you will find my Task App with the database. Open the XAPP/PHPMyAdmin and import this database. Database name should be “dailytaskapp”. Drag and drop my application file (DailyTaskApp) in to the IDE to view the code.
Now Open the CMD in your PC and go the file location where your DailyTaskApp is placed. Then copy and paste that location path way to your CMD (eg: cd Laravel_Projects\Project1) and press enter. The type “php artisan serve” to activate the local host link to this app. You will find a localhost link with the port number (eg: localhost:8000)
Copy and paste that location in your web browser. Then it will open your web app. I have attached some images to show the interface.
